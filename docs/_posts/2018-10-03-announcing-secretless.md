CyberArk is incredibly pleased to announce the beta release of a new open source project, Secretless Broker. Secretless Broker makes secrets management seamless for developers by removing secrets from the application space altogether, so that applications built with Secretless Broker are leak-proof.

Secretless Broker runs locally as an individual process and automatically handles authentication to the protected resources your application needs. Credentials can be consumed seamlessly from a number of providers without any changes to application code.  The entire Lifecycle considerations such as expiration and rotation are handled for you behind the scenes. Secretless Broker won’t log your passwords anywhere – and neither will your application (it can’t)!
